 * Consider an r x c grid where r stands for rows and c stands for columns. Each

 * the connected set of a cell (or a color spot) as the total cells in which we can go from
 * the respective cell by successive displacements on the row or the column, thus keeping
 * the color. The goal is to determine the color and the number of cells of the maximum
 * connected set. In other words, we need to determine the biggest color spot.
